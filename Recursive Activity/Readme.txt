Recursive Activity

1. Can you write a recursive function prime(n) that returns true for a prime number and false for the other? 

For example prime(5) should return true and prime(8) should return false.


2. Can you write a recursive function primeSeq(n) that prints all 	prime number which less than n?

For example prime(10) should print 2,3,5, and 7 on the terminal.


3. Can you write a recursive function returns the addition of numbers from1 to n?

For example sum(5) should print 15


4. Can you write a recursive function to determine even and odd numbers? 


5. Can you write a recursive function to get the addition of all even numbers less than given n.


6. The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . 

Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. 

Write a recursive function print fist n Fibonacci numbers for given n.
